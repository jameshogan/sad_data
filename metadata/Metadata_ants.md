Abstract
--------

What forces structure ecological assemblages? A key limitation to general insights about assemblage structure is the availability of data that are collected at a small spatial grain (local assemblages) and a large spatial extent (global coverage). Here, we present published and unpublished data from 51,388 ant abundance and occurrence records of more than 2693 species and 7953 morphospecies from local assemblages collected at 4212 locations around the world. Ants were selected because they are diverse and abundant globally, comprise a large fraction of animal biomass in most terrestrial communities, and are key contributors to a range of ecosystem functions. Data were collected between 1949 and 2014, and include, for each geo-referenced sampling site, both the identity of the ants collected and details of sampling design, habitat type and degree of disturbance. The aim of compiling this dataset was to provide comprehensive species abundance data in order to test relationships between assemblage structure and environmental and biogeographic factors. Data were collected using a variety of standardised methods, such as pitfall and Winkler traps, and will be valuable for studies investigating large-scale forces structuring local assemblages. Understanding such relationships is particularly critical under current rates of global change. We encourage authors holding additional data on systematically collected ant assemblages, especially those in dry and cold, and remote areas, to contact us and contribute their data to this growing dataset.

Introduction
------------

**General aims of database**

Questions concerning communities, or sets of co-occurring species, are
among the most challenging in ecology (Sutherland et al. 2013).
Ecologists have focussed largely on the role of local-scale biotic and
abiotic processes in determining the diversity and composition of
communities. More recent macroecological work has highlighted that
factors operating at larger scales, such as biogeography (e.g., Violle
et al. 2014) and evolutionary history (e.g., Ricklefs 2008) also play a
role (Sutherland 2013). In addition, chance is important (e.g., Hubbell
2001). Recognition of increasing anthropogenic pressures on assemblages
at multiple scales has also focussed research on understanding
multi-scalar effects of factors such as anthropogenic disturbance,
climate change and species invasions (e.g., Mishra et al. 2004, Woodward
et al. 2010, Pacciardi et al. 2011). Important insights into the
relative importance of different forces in determining assemblage
structure and composition at local scales can be obtained by examining
how their influence changes across broader scales. For example, Gibb et
al. (2015) showed that climate regulates the impact of disturbance on
species richness and evenness. However, very few publicly available
datasets exist that allow researchers to test the effects of broad-scale
drivers on local assemblages. Although plot-based data on plant
assemblages are relatively common (Weiser et al. 2007, Swenson et al.
2012), they often cover only limited geographic or climatic scales
(e.g., Andersen-Teixeira et al. 2015). Analogous data are usually
missing for animals, particularly invertebrates. Terrestrial animal
assemblage datasets often contain only presence-absence information
collected at a coarse spatial grain, precluding meaningful analysis of
species co-occurrence (e.g., PanTHERIA, Jones et al. 2009) or cover only
limited geographic extent (e.g., Atlas of Living Australia,
www.ala.org.au, Carabids.org, Homburg et al. 2014). Other databases
(e.g., PREDICTS, Hudson et al. 2014) focus primarily on human impacts on
biodiversity and are not yet publicly available.

**Why ants?**

Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) were selected as the target taxon
because: (1) ants comprise a large fraction of animal biomass in most
terrestrial communities (King et al. 2013); (2) ants perform a range of
important ecosystem functions (Folgarait 1998, Del Toro et al. 2012);
(3) ant sampling uses standard methods of sampling (i.e., pitfall traps
and Winkler samplers), making inter-site comparisons possible (Agosti et
al. 2000); (4) ant workers are abundant, so they are likely to be
trapped if present; (5) ants are diverse, but more manageable than some
insect groups; (6) data on ant morphology is obtainable from museums and
other collections worldwide; (7) ants are well described relative to
other easily trapped groups and are well documented online through a
unique digital resource of images (antweb.org), catalogue and taxonomic
literature (antbase.org, antcat.org, plazi.org); and (8) a robust
molecular phylogeny of ants to the genus level exists (Ward et al. 2010,
2015, 2016a, 2016b, Moreau and Bell 2013, Brady et al. 2014).

**History of the database**

The database was originally assembled by Dunn et al. (2007), who focused
on total species richness and abundance of georeferenced ant
assemblages. Several papers using that dataset and investigating species
richness and abundance responses to climate have been published (Dunn et
al. 2009, Weiser et al. 2010, Jenkins et al. 2011). More recently, the
database was significantly expanded to include more studies and data on
the abundance of individual species within each assemblage. This has
allowed collaborators to explore questions related to the composition of
species within local assemblages, for example by investigating the
influence of the interactive effects of climate and disturbance on
species richness and evenness (Gibb et al. 2015). Other research
currently in progress using these data includes an examination of global
drivers of the dominance-impoverishment rule (Arnan et al. in prep.),
impacts of invasive species on assemblage structure and composition, and
whether climate differentially affects ants belonging to different
trophic groups (Sagata 2016).

**Suggested links**

The species assemblage database provides opportunities to link data with
pre-existing online databases containing information on taxonomy (e.g.,
AntWeb, <http://www.antweb.org>; Antbase,
[*http://antbase.org*](http://antbase.org); Antcat, <http://antcat.org>
), biogeography (e.g., GABI,
<http://benoitguernard.wordpress.com/gabi-articles/>,
<http://antmaps.org>, Janicki et al. 2016) and species traits (e.g.,
AntProfiler, <http://www.antprofiler.org>, Antkey, <http://antkey.org>).
The authors are also in the process of developing a traits database that
directly complements this database (<http://www.globalants.org>, Parr et
al. in press). Further, data on ant assemblages can be combined with
databases that cover other taxa (e.g., PREDICTS,
<http://www.predicts.org.uk>, Hudson et al. 2014, TERN,
<http://www.tern.org.au/Creating-a-global-vegetation-database-bgp3564.html>)
to ask questions on the drivers of assemblage composition and structure
at broader taxonomic scales.

**Questions**

The database will allow researchers to ask questions about the drivers
of co-existence and diversity of ants at local scales and to separate
the effects of different drivers of global change on species
assemblages. Some questions worthy of investigation include:

-   What are the key environmental drivers of assemblage structure and
    > composition?

-   Does the effect of global change drivers (climate, disturbance and
    > invasive species) on species depend on trophic position, taxonomy
    > or another trait?

-   How do patterns of ant diversity and distribution compare with other
    > better-studied taxa, such as plants and terrestrial vertebrates?

-   What are the global-scale drivers of beta diversity for ants?

-   What are the multi-scalar effects of spatial and temporal
    > environmental heterogeneity on ant diversity?

Getting started
---------------

The database is presented as three separate csv files. These are the
“Source”, “Localities” and “Observations” files, the contents of which
are detailed in the Metadata section of this paper. Broadly, the
**Source** file contains information about where the data came from,
including the details of publications from which it was drawn or whether
it is unpublished data, the **Localities** file includes a range of
information about the studies, such as georeferencing, site
descriptions, including disturbance status, details on trapping methods
and simple measures of total abundance and total species richness for
each locality, and the **Observations** file includes lists of species
or morphospecies collected in each study and a measure of their
abundance.

Files can be linked using the shared terms: Source and Localities files
are linked by the “Source\_ID” term, while Locality and Observation
files are linked using the “Locality\_ID” or “Source\_ID” term,
depending on the resolution required. All Observations data sets can be
linked to Locations data by the “Source\_ID” term, and most can be
linked with the “Locality\_ID” term. There are a few datasets for which
ant assemblage details were not provided at the local scale and
therefore cannot be linked with the “Locality\_ID” term. Using the
“Source\_ID” link gives the assemblage for an entire study (several
localities combined), while using the “Locality\_ID” link gives the
assemblage for individual localities, so is preferable for most
questions. Not all sites given in the Locality file link to Observations
data: for these sites, the data were extracted from papers that reported
only total species richness and abundance (but not species composition).
Limitations of the data are detailed in the “Data limitations” section
of this paper.

A.  **Data limitations **

> Studies were conducted over varying timeframes, at varying scales and
> with a range of sampling methods and efforts, all of which differ in
> the completeness in which they sample assemblages. These elements of
> the dataset are documented so it is possible to use measures of scale
> and trapping effort as covariates in analyses. In some cases different
> trapping methods were pooled, but we have made an effort to keep
> different trapping methods separate as often as possible. Similarly,
> different sampling events at the same locality were sometimes kept
> separate.
>
> There are limitations associated with sampling workers of colonial
> insects. As noted previously (Gotelli et al. 2011), estimating ant
> abundance from the number of workers collected in traps can be
> problematic. Ants vary in colony size, foraging and recruitment
> behaviour and these (along with other factors) will influence the
> number of individuals found in a pitfall trap or Winkler sample. While
> the ideal ecological estimate of abundance would include the number of
> nests or colonies per unit area or sampling effort, the number of
> workers collected still holds value as a measure of relative abundance
> or indication of species-specific activity during the period of
> sampling. For guidelines on how to analyse abundance or occurrence
> data based on worker capture, see Gotelli et al. (2011).
>
> Methods of recording abundances include mainly the total count of
> individuals (abundance) and the count of traps in which a species
> occurs (occurrence), but some studies also report abundances using
> less common metrics, including: mean abundance, proportion of
> occurrence, presence/ absence, adjusted abundance, frequency of
> occurrence, number of nests (nest excavation studies), and categorised
> occurrence, e.g., present in 5 or fewer traps, present in more than 5
> traps. Spatial coverage is somewhat unbalanced, with very few studies
> from Asia and north Africa. Additionally, ants are poorly described in
> some parts of the world and in those areas, morphospecies, rather than
> species, are commonly used in community analyses. Limitations
> associated with the use of morphospecies should be considered when
> using the dataset. These sources of variation may limit the analyses
> that the data can be used for.
